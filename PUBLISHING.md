## Final Publishing Steps

   git commit -m "chore: Bump version to 0.0.2 for release"
   git push
   ```

   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.0.2 -m "v0.0.2"
   git push origin v0.0.2
   ```

3. **Publish to crates.io**
   ```bash
   # Login to crates.io (only needed once)
   cargo login

   # Publish
   cargo publish
   ```

4. **Post-Publishing**
   - Verify the package appears on crates.io
   - Check that docs.rs successfully generated documentation
   - Announce the release in relevant channels if appropriate

## Future Release Recommendations

1. **Before v0.1.0**
   - Complete and thoroughly test the "dimension aliases" feature
   - Gather user feedback on API design and new `/data` endpoint
   - Improve test coverage
   - Consider expanding Arrow integration to other endpoints

2. **For v0.1.0**
   - Consider it the first "stable" pre-release
   - Ensure all planned features for the initial release are complete
   - Freeze the core API design (minimize breaking changes after this)

3. **Towards v1.0.0**
   - Only release v1.0.0 when the API is considered stable
   - Ensure comprehensive documentation
   - Provide migration guides if any breaking changes from v0.x
